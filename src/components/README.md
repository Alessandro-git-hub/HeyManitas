## üßπ Recent Cleanup

### Removed:
- `ServiceCardExamples.jsx` - Unused example code
- `AddJobButton.jsx` - Redundant wrapper around ActionButton
- `firebase-debug.js` - Debug file not needed in codebase

### Improved:
- Organized components by use case for better maintainability
- Updated all import paths to match new structure
- Simplified button components by using ActionButton directly
- Added comprehensive customer management system with CRUD operations
- Integrated customer data with job creation (auto-complete client names)
- **Unified Jobs & Bookings system**: Combined booking requests and job management into single workflow
- **Enhanced JobDetailsModal**: Now supports both jobs and bookings with appropriate field mapping
- **Smart routing**: Old `/worker/bookings` URL redirects to unified `/worker/jobs` page
- **Status transitions**: Bookings can be confirmed to automatically create jobs
